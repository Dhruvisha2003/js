1. Clone the Repository on the First Computer
    1. Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows).
    2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:
        cd path/to/your/directory
    3. Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    4. Navigate into the repository:
        cd repository
2. Make Changes and Push to GitHub
    1. Make some changes to the files in the repository.
    2. Add and commit the changes:
        git add .
        git commit -m "Your commit message"
    3. Push the changes to GitHub:
        git push origin main (Replace 'main' with your branch name if itâ€™s different)
3. Clone the Repository on the Second Computer
    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:
        cd path/to/your/directory
    3. Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    4. Navigate into the repository:
        cd repository

    1. Pull the latest changes from GitHub to ensure you have the most recent version:
        git pull origin main
    2. Make changes, add, commit, and push:
        git add .
        git commit -m "Your commit message"
        git push origin main
5. Synchronize Changes Between Both Computers (Whenever you make changes on one computer and push them to GitHub, follow these steps on the other computer to get the latest changes:)
    1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository:
        cd path/to/your/directory/repository
    2. Pull the latest changes from GitHub:
